You are looking at the now inactive repository for Vue 2. The actively maintained repository for the latest version of Vue is vuejs/core.

Vue has reached End of Life on December 31st, 2023. It no longer receives new features, updates, or fixes. However, it is still available on all existing distribution channels (CDNs, package managers, Github, etc).

If you are starting a new project, please start with the latest version of Vue (3.x). We also strongly recommend current Vue 2 users to upgrade (guide), but we also acknowledge that not all users have the bandwidth or incentive to do so. If you have to stay on Vue 2 but also have compliance or security requirements about unmaintained software, check out Vue 2 NES.
